/* @title: Interesting sequence
 * @author: Chelsea Valentine

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that reads as input from the user a single positive integer, call it n, and then uses n
 * to compute the next number in the sequence as follows:
 * 
 * [*] if n is even, the next number n is divided by 2 (integer division)
 * [*] if n is odd, the next number is n multiplied by 3 plus 1
 * 
 * The next number is computed based on the previous value and so on... For example, if n starts at 11, the
 * sequence is 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, ...
 * 
 * This algorithm produces an infinite sequence of numbers. Compute the first hundred terms of the sequence
 * and print the numbers using standard output. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a single space.
 * Run your program several times using different input numbers. What do you notice about sequences? (Answer
 * this question in the comments below the code in your program.)
 * 
 * Note: provide user interface that prompts the user for the input.

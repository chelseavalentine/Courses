/* @title: Reverse String

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user for a string and then prints out the same string in reverse. You
 * should allow the user to enter spaces in the string. The user hits enter when they're done with the input.
 * You're not allowed to use the method reverse() from the String class. Implement your own method that given
 * a String object as a parameter, returns a String object that is a reverse of the parameter. Your method
 * should have the following signature:
 * 
 * 		public static String reverse ( String textToReverse )
 * 
 * Hint: note the difference b/t next() & nextLine() Scanner methods
 * Note: document your method as we discussed in class
 */

public class ReverseString {
	public static void main (String[] args){
		
	}
}

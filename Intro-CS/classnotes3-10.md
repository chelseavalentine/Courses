*********** New things in Object-Oriented Java Programming ***********

no main method;

data fields -- variables outside of methods
	- data fields w/ "private" protects the data within the class
		- "private" = only methods from the same class can access it


- "public" goes in front of the class
	- if skipped, the default goes to package

- "static" is missing from methods

- new type of methods: * constructors*
	- no return type (can't specify it)
	- name has to be the same as the name of the class
	- usually public

-- primitive variables are stored on the stack
-- anything new or allocated to an object is stored in the heap

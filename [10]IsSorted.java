 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of 10 integers. Your program should save
 * the numbers to an array & then verify if the list is sorted or not. If the numbers are sorted,
 * your program should print the message "Your list is sorted" to the console. If not, "Your list
 * is NOT sorted".
 * 
 * Note 1: You must have a method that given a list of numbers, determines if they're sorted
 * Note 2: You should be able to only make 1 pass through the array to determine if the content
 * is sorted or not -- plan your solution before implementing the program.

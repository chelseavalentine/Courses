 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a method to sort fruits. Pick your favorite algorithm. Start with ArrayOperations.java file
 * from lecture05 notes. Add your own implementation of a sort for strings and use it to sort the
 * mixed fruit. Modify the main() method to display mixedFruit array before and after it is sorted.
 * Your method should modify (i.e. sort) the array that's passed to it. Your method should have the
 * following header:
 * 		public static sort (String [] list)
 * 
 * Hint: remember that the == operator can't be used to compare two strings.

public class SortedFruit {
	public static void main(String[] args){

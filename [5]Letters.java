/* @title: Vowel or consonant?
 * @author: Chelsea Valentine
 * @date:

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a single character from the keyboard and then checks if
 * it is a letter, and if so, determines if it is a consonant or a vowel.
 * 
 * Note 1: You should read chapter 4 before attempting this problem.
 * Note 2: Think the problem through. The task of determining if the letter is a consonant or a vowel can 
 * be solved in many ways: some of them take much longer to implement (try to find a short way)

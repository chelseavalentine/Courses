/* @title: Generating Cards

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that generates a random poker hand of cards (5 random cards). Each card should come
 * from a 52 card deck. The standard deck has 4 suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. In each suit there
 * are 13 cards: ace, king, queen, jack, & the number cards from 2 to 10.
 * 
 * The main() method of your program is responsible for generating the hand and printing the results to the
 * screen. You should also have a method that generates a single random card from a 52 card deck. (Hint: the
 * main() method should make 5 calls to that method.)
 * 
 * Your program should print the names of the suit and the card "number" of all 5 randomly generated cards.
 * (eg. Your hand is:
 * 		9 of Spaces
 * 		...)
 * 
 * You don't need to worry about repetitions of a card.
 * 
 * Note 1: Use a random number generator to pick a random card.
 * Note 2: Your program shouldn't have a huge switch/if-else statement w/ 52 cases.
 * Note 3: Your program doesn't ask the user for anything.
 * 
 * Extra credit: Modify the program to make sure the cards in the generated hand are unique -- there's no
 * chance of a repeated card.

/* @title: Distance of two points
 * @author: Chelsea Valentine
 * 
 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length of the side of a hexagon and computes its area and perimeter.
 * The area of a hexagon with size x can be computed using:
 * 
 * Area = (6x^2)/(4tan(pi/6))
 * 
 * and the perimeter of a hexagon with size x can be computed using:
 * 
 * Perimeter = 6x.
 * 
 * Note 1: You can use Math.tan(a) to compute tan(a)
 * Note 2: There's no exponentiation operator in Java. In order to square a number, you can either multiply it by itself (good solution),
 * or use Math.pow(a, 2) (bad solution)

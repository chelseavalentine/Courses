/* @title: Shifting Strings
 * @author: Chelsea Valentine

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user for a string and then prints out the same string shifted by one
 * character to the right. The last character should become the first one after the shift. You should use
 * toCharArray() method from the String class to convert the String that you read from the user to individual
 * characters. The array of characters should then be shifted by one character to the right. For example:
 * 
 * If the user enters "Hello", you shift the string to "oHell"
 * 
 * Once the shift is done, the character array should be converted back to string and displayed to the user.
 * 
 * The  shift operation should be performed by a method with the following header:
 *			public static String shift ( String word )
 *
 * Hint: given a char array called letters, you can convert it to a string using the following syntax:
 *
 *		String shiftedWord = new String (letters);
 *
 * Extra credit: Implement a second method that shifts a string by an arbitrary number of letters. The number
 * should be provided as a parameter to the method:
 * 		public static String shift ( String word, int numberToShift )
 */

public class ShiftString {
	public static void main (String[] args){
		
	}
}

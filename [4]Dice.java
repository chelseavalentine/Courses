 * @title: Rolling a Dice
 * @name: Chelsea Valentine
 * 
 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that simulates rolling a dice. Your program should roll a single dice 100,000 times and
 * count occurrences of each result. Once you have the totals, your program should display the percentage
 * of times that each score was achieved.
 * 
 * The numbers should be displayed with exactly four decimal places followed by a percent sign.
 * 
 * Note 1: Your numbers should add up to about 100, but may not add up to exactly 100.
 * Note 2: This program is not interactive. It does not take any input from the user.

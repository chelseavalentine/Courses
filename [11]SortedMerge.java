 * @title: Merge two lists
 * @author: Chelsea Valentine

 * Assignment:
 * 
 * Write a program that merges two lists of sorted whole numbers entered by the user. The program
 * should use merge method with the following header:
 * 		public static int [] merge (int [] list1, int [] list2)
 * 
 * The list returned by the method should contain all elements of the sorted list1 and sorted list2.
 * The list returned by the method should be sorted. Your implementation should be as efficient as
 * possible. Use the isSorted() method (that you developed in problem 1) to verify that both lists are
 * sorted from smallest to largest & that your merged list is sorted.
 * 
 * Your program should ask the user for the length of each list and then read in the content of the
 * two lists. Your program should print to the console the content of the merged list (numbers
 * should be separated by commas and spaces).
 * 
 * Hint: Don't copy the 2 lists into a new array and sort the whole array. Take advantage of the
 * fact that both list1 and list2 are in sorted order.
 * 
 * Note: Don't use Arrays or ArrayList classes.

public class SortedMerge {
	public static void main(String[] args){
